## Introduction

ScreenConnect Client is a lightweight remote access and support application designed for secure, reliable connectivity between endpoints. It enables technicians and authorized users to establish remote sessions for troubleshooting, maintenance, configuration, and monitoring across Windows environments. The client typically launches on demand or can be deployed for persistent access, depending on organizational policy and use case. It supports encrypted communications to help protect session data, credentials, and transferred information while operating over standard network connections.

The application is commonly used in IT service desks, managed service providers, and enterprise support teams to reduce downtime and accelerate incident resolution. Once installed or executed, ScreenConnect Client can connect to a designated ScreenConnect/ConnectWise Control server, where sessions are authenticated and managed. During a session, operators can view and control the remote desktop, exchange files, run diagnostics, and guide end users through steps in real time. For unattended support scenarios, administrators can deploy the client via standard software distribution methods and manage access permissions centrally.

ScreenConnect Client is built to work efficiently on typical hardware and network conditions, minimizing resource consumption while maintaining a responsive user experience. Logging and session controls can assist with auditing and compliance requirements. Whether used for quick one-time assistance or ongoing endpoint management, ScreenConnect Client provides a professional remote support workflow with a focus on security, performance, and operational simplicity.
